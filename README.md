MySnippets
==========

A collection of snippets I"ve found useful.

I've only packaged these up so I can sync them between machines nicely. This might as well even be a private repo.

I suppose if you want to use them, go ahead. This project distributed under the Unlicense as far as permitted by Visual Studio. I haven't really looked into it.
